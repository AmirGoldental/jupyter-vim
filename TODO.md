This is a list of things I'm planning to work on with vim-ipython

[ ] opening docs while shell buffer is open somehow scroll-locks things, and
    does not compute the proper length

[ ] split up vim-specific things from python-specific things 
    (make it easier to become py3k compliant) 

[ ] py3k support

[ ] vim ipython magic has no documentation that gets installed (fix this)

[ ] support for non-python kernels (IJulia, IHaskell kernel)

[ ] provide g:ipy variables to set the initial state of python vars 
    e.g. monitor_subchannel

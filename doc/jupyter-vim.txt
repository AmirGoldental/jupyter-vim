================================================================================
INTRODUCTION 					*jupyter-vim*

Whenever you edit a python file, a set of commands is defined that serve as
a gateway to the ipython kernel. If you do not have a kernel running, the plugin
will silently fail and the functionality will not be available. This feature
prevents "error vomit" at startup on systems where it is not compatible. If you
manually run the configure command, you will indeed get the appropriate errors
to assist in debugging.
